## The Problem We Solve

As a builder, you face three critical challenges:

1. **Lead Overload**: You receive leads from multiple sources (website, ads, referrals) but struggle to identify which ones will actually convert
2. **Manual Follow-ups**: You spend hours calling, messaging, and scheduling site visits manually, leaving room for leads to go cold
3. **Lost Opportunities**: Without proper tracking and automation, hot leads slip through the cracks, and you miss the best time to contact them

**Tharaga solves all three problems with intelligent automation and AI-powered insights.**

## What Makes Tharaga Different

### 1. **AI-Powered Lead Scoring (0-10 Scale)**
Every lead is automatically scored based on:
- **Behavioral Data**: Which properties they view, how long they spend, what they click
- **Engagement Level**: Response rates, interaction frequency, device usage
- **Budget Indicators**: Property price ranges viewed, search patterns
- **Timing Intelligence**: When they're most active, optimal contact times

**Result**: You instantly know which leads are "Hot" (9-10), "Warm" (7-8), or need nurturing. Focus your time on leads that will actually convert.

### 2. **Kanban Pipeline Management**
Visual drag-and-drop pipeline that shows your entire sales funnel:
- **9 Stages**: New Leads → Contacted → Qualified → Visit Scheduled → Visit Completed → Negotiation → Offer Made → Closed Won/Lost
