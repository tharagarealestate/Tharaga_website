# Homepage Structure Analysis for Claude AI Prompt Generation

## Input Paragraph for Claude AI:

The Tharaga website homepage is built on Next.js 14 (App Router) with a hybrid static/React architecture. **The header is NOT from a React component—it's a static HTML element in `app/public/index.html`** (lines 41-1500+). The header uses glassmorphic styling matching the pricing page design exactly: fixed positioning on homepage (top: 16px, centered, 1200px max-width, rounded-24px container with `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)` background, `blur(24px)`, gold border `2px solid rgba(212, 175, 55, 0.5)`, z-index: 9999). The header already has a continuous shimmer animation via `::before` pseudo-element (lines 69-83 in index.html) using `linear-gradient(90deg, transparent, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1), transparent)` that animates from -100% to 100% every 3 seconds. However, the pricing page cards (`app/components/pricing/PricingCard.tsx` line 60) use a **hover-based shimmer effect** that sweeps across on hover: `bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-white/10 to-transparent` with `-translate-x-full group-hover:translate-x-full transition-transform duration-1000`. The header includes: brand logo "THARAGA", trust pill "Verified • Broker‑free", Features dropdown, Portal dropdown, Pricing link, and auth buttons. The homepage uses `homepage-header` class on body and `hero-premium` class to trigger special styling. Current homepage sections in `app/public/index.html` (to be deleted except header): (1) Hero Section (`hero-premium`) with dark gradient background, headline, trust cards, CTAs, social proof, floating shapes, 3D property card; (2) Trial CTA Section; (3) Value Proposition Section with 6-card grid; (4) How It Works Section with iframe; (5) Footer. The design system uses: premium blue (#1e40af) and gold (#d4af37), Playfair Display/Plus Jakarta Sans fonts, glassmorphism (blur 24px), shimmer animations (both continuous and hover-based), pulse-slow animations. Header styling is in both `app/public/index.html` (inline styles) and `app/app/layout.tsx` (lines 690-1100+). The homepage route is `app/app/page.tsx` (currently backed up as `.backup`). **The header must remain untouched and should have the exact pricing page design with shimmering effect**—preferably the hover-based shimmer like pricing cards for interactivity, or enhanced continuous shimmer. Generate an ultra-detailed implementation prompt that will delete all homepage sections except the header and create a completely new design, ensuring the header maintains the exact pricing page glassmorphic design with shimmer effects (either hover-based or enhanced continuous shimmer).
