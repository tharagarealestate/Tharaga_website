# NOTE: AWS Lambda has a 4KB limit on environment variables per function.
# Netlify passes ALL site environment variables to ALL functions by default.
# If you exceed this limit, you'll see: "Your environment variables exceed the 4KB limit"
# 
# SOLUTION: Remove duplicate environment variables in Netlify Dashboard:
# 1. Remove SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE (keep only SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)
# 2. Review and remove any other unused/duplicate variables
# 3. See NETLIFY_ENV_VAR_4KB_FIX.md for detailed instructions

## Proxy SPECIFIC API routes to Cloud Run backend
## IMPORTANT: Next.js API routes in app/app/api/* take precedence
## Only proxy routes that don't exist in Next.js API routes
## Next.js routes handled locally: /api/leads/*, /api/builder/*, /api/analytics/*, /api/me/*, /api/properties/*, /api/admin/metrics/*, /api/team-members/*, /api/tracking/*, /api/trial/*, /api/health/*, /api/__vitals
## External backend routes (proxied): Only routes NOT in Next.js
## Note: Netlify redirects are evaluated BEFORE Next.js routes, so we need to be specific
## The catch-all below is commented out - Next.js routes will handle their own paths
