## Proxy SPECIFIC API routes to Cloud Run backend
## IMPORTANT: Next.js API routes in app/app/api/* take precedence
## Only proxy routes that don't exist in Next.js API routes
## Next.js routes handled locally: /api/leads/*, /api/builder/*, /api/analytics/*, /api/me/*, /api/properties/*, /api/admin/metrics/*, /api/team-members/*, /api/tracking/*, /api/trial/*, /api/health/*, /api/__vitals
## External backend routes (proxied): Only routes NOT in Next.js
## Note: Netlify redirects are evaluated BEFORE Next.js routes, so we need to be specific
## The catch-all below is commented out - Next.js routes will handle their own paths
